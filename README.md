Personal functions that I am using across multiple research cycles. This package is available to install via {devtools} from within R and each function contains documentation. 

`create_child_binaries` is under development pending changes to the clog production and completion workflow.
I am going to review `update_parent_from_binaries` and see if it is still necessary considering `cleaningtools::recreate_parent_column()`.
