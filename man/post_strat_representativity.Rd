\title{Calculate design effect, effective sample size, and margin of error from post-stratification weights}
\usage{
post_strat_representativity(w)
}
\arguments{
\item{w}{A numeric vector containing post-stratification weights.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{n}{Number of observations.}
\item{mean_weight}{Mean of weights.}
\item{sd_weight}{Standard deviation of weights.}
\item{cv_weight}{Coefficient of variation â€” how uneven the weights are.}
\item{design_effect}{Variance inflation due to weighting.}
\item{effective_n}{Equivalent unweighted sample size after weighting.}
\item{margin_of_error_95}{Approximate 95\\% margin of error (in percentage points) for a proportion near 0.5.}
}
}
\description{
This helper function estimates the statistical precision of a weighted sample by
calculating the effective sample size and design effect (following Kish 1992).
It is useful when post-stratification weights are applied to correct for unequal
probabilities of selection across strata.
